# Cryptboard

Test project for messing around with cryptocurrencies.

Built with React, Redux, and AntDesign.

Heavily inspired by [this youtube tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DDX3US3kss)  
(Solid reference video, but several portions of it are either outdated or broken, e.g., usage of react-router-dom)

## Notable changes:
- code compatibility for updated libraries/apis
    - React Router, Chart.js, Coinranking(API)
- fixed disabled code portions
    - Proper chart data display
    - css changes
    - middleware support for Redux/RTK Query
    - miscellaneous changes for stability & compatibility with react
- deployed with github pages(github actions)

UPDATE: the Coinranking API has changed their billing policy, disabling /exchanges endpoint to free users for now.
